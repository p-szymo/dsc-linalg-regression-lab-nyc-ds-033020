    "# Regression with Linear Algebra - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll apply regression analysis using simple matrix manipulations to fit a model to given data, and then predict new values for previously unseen data. You'll follow the approach highlighted in the previous lesson where you used NumPy to build the appropriate matrices and vectors and solve for the $\\beta$ (unknown variables) vector. The beta vector will be used with test data to make new predictions. You'll also evaluate the model fit.\n",
    "In order to make this experiment interesting, you'll use NumPy at every single stage of this experiment, i.e., loading data, creating matrices, performing train-test split, model fitting, and evaluation.\n",

    "## Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you'll use for this experiment is \"**Sales Prices in the City of Windsor, Canada**\", something very similar to the Boston Housing dataset. This dataset contains a number of input (independent) variables, including area, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, facilities(AC/garage), etc. and an output (dependent) variable, **price**.  You'll formulate a linear algebra problem to find linear mappings from input features using the equation provided in the previous lesson. \n",

    "\n",
    "The focus of this lab is not really answering a preset analytical question, but to learn how you can perform a regression experiment, using mathematical manipulations - similar to the one you performed using `statsmodels`.

    "\n",
    "* Drop the first row of csv file as it contains the names of variables (header) which won't be used during analysis (keeping this will cause errors as it contains text values) \n",
